# Ship Feature — pipeline orchestrator

Drive a feature from request to merge-ready by orchestrating specialised subagents.
**You — the main session — are the orchestrator.** The code-acting and review agents
are **leaf workers**: none of them holds the `Task` tool, so none can spawn another.
(The two upstream authoring agents — `spec-creator` and `implementation-planner` — may
delegate a *read-only* lookup to `researcher`, but never orchestrate.) Every sequencing,
fan-out, and loop-back decision happens here, in you. You spawn each agent with the
`Task` tool, read what it returns, and decide the next step.

Because a subagent gets **no parent conversation history**, you must hand each one the
context it needs *in its prompt*: the project profile from Step 0.5, the spec path, the
plan path, the diff base (the repo's mainline branch), the changed-file list, and — when
looping back — the exact findings to fix. Two files are the durable contracts that tie
the stages together: the **spec** (the WHAT/WHY) and the **plan** (the HOW); their
locations come from Step 0.5, defaulting to `specs/SPEC-NN-<date>-<slug>.md` and
`docs/plans/<slug>.md`.

## Which agents are present

Not every stage's agent is guaranteed to be installed. Three stages are **optional**:
`test-writer` (Step 6), `security-reviewer` (Step 7), and `doc-writer` (Step 9). The rest
— `researcher`, `spec-creator`, `implementation-planner`, `spec-conformance`,
`implementer`, `plan-verifier`, `architecture-reviewer` — always are.

**Before dispatching an optional agent, check it exists**: look for its `subagent_type` in
the available-agent list your `Task` tool exposes. If it is absent, **skip that step** —
say so in the running progress and record it in the final report (Step 10) — and continue
the pipeline. Never substitute a different agent silently, never let the main session
quietly do the work in its place, and never report a step as done when it never ran. A
missing `test-writer` in particular must be stated **loudly** in the final report:
shipping unverified code while implying it was tested is the worst outcome this pipeline
can produce.

## Pipeline at a glance

```
project discovery → researcher? → spec-creator → [SPEC APPROVAL] → implementation-planner
   → spec-conformance (plan ⊨ spec?) → [PLAN APPROVAL] → implementer(s) → test-writer†
   → ‖ architecture-reviewer ‖ security-reviewer† ‖ plan-verifier ‖
   → blocking findings? ─yes→ implementer → re-review (loop)
                        └no→ doc-writer†? → report

† optional agent — skip the step (and say so) if it isn't installed
```

Serialise the build-up stages (each needs the previous one's output); **parallelise the
reviewers** (independent and read-only). Run the whole thing top to bottom; don't skip
the approval gates or the review loop. `spec-conformance` is a serial gate on the *plan
document* — it is not one of the parallel code reviewers.

## The two rules that actually change outcomes

Most of this pipeline is what a careful engineer would do anyway — scope-check, spec,
plan, approval gates, parallel review. These two calls are the easy-to-miss ones that
quietly go wrong without a checklist. If you remember nothing else, remember these:

1. **A non-blocking finding is a note, never a loop-back.** Once you've judged a finding
   non-blocking (Step 8's table), do *not* hand it to the implementer "while we're here."
   That re-opens a clean change and turns a `WARNING` into churn — scope creep disguised
   as efficiency. Record it in the report and move on.
2. **Converge deliberately; adjudicate a dispute once, then escalate.** The review loop
   must terminate (Step 8). When the implementer *disputes* a finding rather than failing
   to fix it, don't re-loop it and don't silently drop it — have the *owning reviewer*
   adjudicate the rebuttal exactly once, then stop and let the human decide if it stands.

## Step 0 — Capture the request and scope-check

Take the feature request from the user's `/sdd-engineering:ship-feature` argument or their message. If
it's too vague to start (no clear outcome, or several plausible interpretations), ask
1–3 clarifying questions with `AskUserQuestion` **before** spawning anything — the
`spec-creator` will do a deeper clarify pass, but a request that's ambiguous about its
*goal* wastes the whole pipeline. If the request is actually a one-line fix, say so and
offer to just do it directly rather than spinning up the pipeline. If the user already
has an agreed spec, skip Step 2 and start at Step 3 with it.

## Step 0.5 — establish the project profile, once

**You discover the repository; the subagents don't.** Following this plugin's
[`references/project-discovery.md`](../../references/project-discovery.md), read the root
`CLAUDE.md` (else the README and the package manifests) **once** and write down a short
**project profile**:

- **Module map** — which modules/packages exist, what each is for, and any dependency
  order between them.
- **Stack** — framework, ORM, test runner, package manager.
- **Verification commands** — how to typecheck / lint / test / build, and where they run.
- **Test conventions** — naming, unit-vs-integration split.
- **Artifact locations** — where specs and plans live. If the repo's `CLAUDE.md` states
  them, use those. If it doesn't, **ask the user**, then default to `specs/` and
  `docs/plans/`. Don't assert a convention the repo never stated.
- **Do-not-touch** — generated/vendored paths and anything the repo marks off-limits.

Keep it compact — a dozen lines, not a transcript — and **paste it verbatim into every
subagent prompt** from here on. This is the single largest cost lever in the pipeline: if
each of a dozen leaf agents re-reads `CLAUDE.md` to rediscover the same module map, you
pay for that discovery a dozen times (see the cost-discipline reference). Tell each agent:
*"the profile below is authoritative — don't re-read `CLAUDE.md` to confirm it."*

If discovery comes up empty on something a step needs — no documented test command, say —
surface that to the user rather than letting a subagent guess.

## Step 1 — researcher (optional)

If the feature hinges on something you don't already know (how an existing subsystem
works, a library's behavior, an API contract), spawn `researcher` for a targeted
lookup and feed its answer into the spec or plan. Prefix the ask with `[code]` or
`[web]` to force the search type. **Skip this** when the spec-creator's or the
`implementation-planner` agent's own reading will clearly suffice — don't pad the pipeline.

**Always spawn the tiered `researcher` (Sonnet) for exploration — never
`general-purpose`, or a bare `Agent`/`Task` with no `subagent_type`.** Those default to the
orchestrator's tier (usually Opus), so a cheap Sonnet lookup silently becomes an Opus one;
pass `model: haiku` for a reasoning-light sweep. This is the same tiering rule Step 5
applies to code work — see the cost-discipline reference.

## Step 2 — spec-creator, then STOP at the spec approval gate

Spawn `spec-creator` with the (clarified) request. It emits a **Clarification response**
first — restated request, design-gap analysis, and blocking questions — and **waits**.
Relay those questions to the user, collect answers, and pass them back so it can write
the spec to the spec location from Step 0.5 (by default
`specs/SPEC-NN-<date>-<slug>.md`) with EARS acceptance criteria (each with a stable
`AC-N` id) and a `Status: draft`.

**This is the first hard human checkpoint.** Present the spec path and a short summary
and **wait for approval of the WHAT/WHY** before any planning. Getting scope, non-goals,
and acceptance criteria right here is what makes everything downstream cheap to run.

**Skip this stage** only when the requirements are already crisp, small, and written
down — then hand the request straight to Step 3 and note you skipped the spec.

## Step 3 — implementation-planner, then STOP at the plan approval gate

Spawn `implementation-planner` with the **approved spec path** and the project profile.
It also emits a **Clarification response** and waits — but its questions are **HOW-level
only** (execution mode, technical gaps). The spec's ACs are settled WHAT; **don't let the
two clarify gates re-ask the same thing** — if `implementation-planner` raises a question
the spec already answered, resolve it from the spec rather than bouncing it to the user
again.

It asks one thing you must relay: **execution mode.**

- **Multi-agent (parallel)** — for a larger feature, the plan is shaped for concurrency:
  non-overlapping `Owned paths`, an explicit dependency DAG, contracts defined first.
- **Single-agent (one pass)** — for small or tightly-coupled work, a lean ordered
  sequence for one implementer.

The agent recommends one; the user decides. It then writes the ordered, verifiable
plan to the plan location from Step 0.5 (by default `docs/plans/<slug>.md`) — restating
each spec AC and citing its id — and returns the path.

**Do not present the plan for final approval yet — run Step 4 first**, so the human
approves a plan that's already been checked for spec coverage.

## Step 4 — spec-conformance (the plan ⊨ spec gate)

Spawn `spec-conformance` with **both** the spec path and the plan path. It's a fast,
read-only, `sonnet` check over the two *documents* (no code exists yet): every spec AC
must map to an owning task (Covered / Partial / Uncovered), and every plan task must
trace back to an AC (no plan scope creep). It returns a traceability matrix + verdict.

- **Gaps (`🔴`)** — an Uncovered/Partial AC, or a substantive unrequested task — loop
  back to `implementation-planner` with **only** those gaps to revise the plan, then re-run
  this check. This is cheap (two documents on `sonnet`); catching a dropped AC here
  saves a whole wasted implementer run.
- **Clean (`✅`)** — present the plan path, the conformance verdict, and a short summary
  to the user and **wait for their go**. This is the second hard human checkpoint; the
  conformance pass makes it a fast yes.

**Skip this stage** only when you skipped the spec (Step 2) — with no spec there is
nothing to conform to; the human approves the plan directly.

## Step 5 — implementer

**Pre-flight for greenfield / new-dependency work.** Before committing a long implementer
run, do a ~30-second reachability check on anything the plan *assumes* but hasn't proven:
can the new dependency actually install, is Docker up if the tests need it, does the
external API authenticate? A cheap probe up front beats discovering a hard blocker 30
minutes into an expensive run. Skip it when the change only touches code and tooling
already present in the repo.

**Scope the implementer to source, not tests.** The
implementer writes and changes production **code** and self-verifies by *running* the
project profile's typecheck / lint / build commands and the **existing** test suite — it
does **not** author new test files. `test-writer` (Step 6) owns all new test authoring.
State this in every implementer prompt (leaf agents get no history): *"implement the
source and run the existing checks; a `test-writer` adds the tests."* This isn't
bureaucracy — authoring tests inside the implementer's large,
per-turn-re-billing context is what made one real run's implementer **33% of spend** while
`test-writer` was **1%**; the split is a cost win, not overhead.
**Watch the account session budget on a long, many-agent run.** A mid-run cap kills
in-flight agents and dumps the recovery onto the (Opus) orchestrator — in one run the final
wave's two agents both died on a cap, one having written nothing (pure wasted spend). When a
run has already spawned many long agents, launch the last waves **smaller / serially or with
a checkpoint** (glance at `/status` for remaining budget) so a cap's blast radius is one
small piece, not a whole wave.

Once approved, execute the plan:

**Every code-writing dispatch MUST pass `subagent_type: implementer`** (as Step 1 requires
`researcher` for exploration). A bare `Agent`/`Task` with no `subagent_type` silently runs
as `general-purpose` at the orchestrator's tier — on an Opus main loop that means
Opus-priced mechanical component builds. In one real `ship-feature` run the Wave-4/5
component dispatches omitted it and ran on Opus (surfacing as the `/cost` panel's
"general-purpose" subagent line), while the correctly-typed Waves 1–3 ran Sonnet at equal
quality — the single largest avoidable cost of that run. Verify tiering after a fan-out:
`/cost` should show the code waves under `implementer` (Sonnet), not `general-purpose`.

- **Single-agent plan** — spawn one `implementer` with the plan path. It writes the source
  and self-verifies by running the project profile's typecheck / lint / build commands and
  the existing tests.
- **Multi-agent plan** — fan out **one `implementer` per non-overlapping `Owned paths`
  group, in the plan's dependency order** (the module map from Step 0.5 tells you what
  that order is for this repo). Only launch concurrently the tasks whose `Depends-on` are
  already satisfied and whose owned paths don't overlap. **Thread the real exported
  signature / route contract** each upstream layer produced into the next agent's prompt —
  subagents share no memory, so a downstream agent that has to guess the upstream
  interface re-introduces the drift the split was meant to avoid. Prefer this split when
  the feature spans **>1 module** or **~15+ files** or a single run you expect to exceed
  **~150 turns** (see cost discipline); below that, one implementer is cheaper. **The
  file/turn threshold applies *within* a single module too** — a build that touches one
  module but a dozen-plus files across several concerns is over the line: split it **by
  sub-layer** (foundation → components → wiring), not one mega-agent. A ~274-turn
  single-module implementer that dropped mid-run once cost a whole recovery agent
  re-reading already-built siblings — a sub-layer split keeps a drop's blast radius to one
  small piece.

If any implementer reports the plan is structurally wrong, stop and take that back to the
user / the `implementation-planner` agent — don't push it to guess.

## Step 6 — test-writer (optional agent)

**Check `test-writer` is available first.** If it isn't installed, skip this step, tell
the user plainly that no new tests were authored because the agent is absent, and carry
that skip into the final report as a headline item — not a footnote. `plan-verifier`
(Step 7) then becomes your only coverage signal; ask it explicitly to name every untested
path it finds.

`test-writer` is the pipeline's **only** author of new test files. Spawn it to add
behavior-focused tests for the change and **run** them; it pastes real test output, which
you capture as evidence for the review stage. Give it the project profile's test
conventions and test command so it reuses the repo's existing patterns.

**Don't fold this into the implementer.** Skipping a full agent run because the implementer
"could just add the tests" looks cheaper and isn't: authoring tests inside the implementer's
large, per-turn-re-billing context costs *more* than a fresh, lean `test-writer` (one real
run: implementer **33%** of spend vs test-writer **1%**), and it means the implementer grades
its own homework. Keep the stage separate.

**The only case for skipping** `test-writer` is a change that genuinely needs no new tests —
a docs-only, config, or trivial edit that adds no behavior. Even then, `plan-verifier`'s
standing coverage check (Step 7) still runs the independent "is anything untested?" pass, so
nothing rides on the implementer's self-verification alone.

## Step 7 — review, in parallel

First compute the change set once so every reviewer shares one ground truth, against the
repo's mainline branch (`main`, `master`, or whatever the repo uses):

```sh
git diff --name-only $(git merge-base <mainline> HEAD)..HEAD
```

Then **fan the reviewers out in parallel — in a single message** (multiple `Task` calls
at once). Give each the project profile, the plan path, the diff base, and the
changed-file list in its prompt — `architecture-reviewer` has **no Bash**, so it relies on
the list you pass.

**Right-size the set to the diff — don't reflexively spawn every reviewer.** Each pass costs
a full agent run, and a strong orchestrator already prunes; make that pruning explicit
and safe rather than leaving it to chance:

- **plan-verifier — always.** It's your **code-vs-plan** completeness + scope gate *and*
  the standing coverage backstop (the post-code mirror of Step 4's plan⊨spec check). Tell
  it to default to **blocking completeness** — missing tools/requirements, unhonored
  locked decisions, scope creep — rather than an exhaustive requirement-by-requirement
  matrix; the full matrix is the parallel long-pole (it ran 2–3× the other reviewers on a
  real run), so reserve it for an explicit deep pass. And always ask it to **assess test
  coverage and name any untested critical path** — the independent backstop that catches
  anything `test-writer` missed, or verifies the rare "no new tests needed" skip (Step 6).
- **architecture-reviewer — when the diff changes structure**: new modules, moved
  boundaries, dependency direction, cross-layer wiring. Skip it for a localized change
  that touches no seams — say so in one line.
- **security-reviewer (optional agent) — mandatory whenever the diff touches a real
  attack surface**: auth, routes/endpoints, secrets, an LLM prompt path (lethal
  trifecta), file/path access, DB queries or migrations, or any outbound call.
  **Otherwise you may skip it with a one-line justification** — e.g. a pure client-side
  render/filter over already-fetched data crosses no trust boundary — and do the trivial
  input/allowlist check yourself. **When in doubt, run it:** a missed `High` costs far
  more than one reviewer pass. **If the agent isn't installed**, you cannot run it: say so
  where you'd otherwise justify the skip, and if the diff *does* touch an attack surface,
  flag in the final report that the change went unreviewed for security and recommend a
  human security pass before merge.

The reviewers you run have non-overlapping lanes by design; don't merge their roles.

## Step 8 — gate and loop-back

Collect the reports and decide what is **blocking**:

| Reviewer | Blocking | Not blocking (note, don't loop) |
|----------|----------|----------------------------------|
| architecture-reviewer | any `CRITICAL` | `WARNING` / `SUGGESTION` |
| security-reviewer | any **High** | **Medium/Low** — judge against the threat model* |
| plan-verifier | any **Missing**, or **substantive out-of-scope** change, or a `GAP` verdict | **Partial** — judge; **incidental** out-of-scope |

\* Judge severity against **this repo's** threat model, which the root `CLAUDE.md` usually
states (who the users are, what's exposed, whether routes are authenticated). A bug that
crosses no trust boundary under that model — e.g. one only a trusted local operator can
trigger in a single-user local tool — is a down-rank, not a blocker. Reserve blocking for
harm that crosses a real boundary. If the repo documents no threat model, treat any
`High` as blocking.

If there are **no blocking findings**, go to Step 9. Otherwise:

1. Consolidate the blocking findings into one clear list (`file:line` + what to change).
2. Spawn the **owning writer** with **only** that list: source/behavior fixes →
   `implementer`; a missing-tests / untested-critical-path finding (typically from
   `plan-verifier`) → `test-writer`. Keep the Step-5/6 lane split on loop-back too — don't
   hand a coverage gap to the implementer. (Most loop-backs are source fixes → implementer.)
   If `test-writer` isn't installed, a coverage finding has no owner: don't reroute it to
   the implementer — carry it to the user as an open item in the final report.
3. Re-run **only the affected reviewers** (e.g. if only security flagged, re-run
   security + plan-verifier for scope; skip architecture if untouched).
4. Repeat.

**Convergence guard — don't loop forever.** End the loop when reviews come back clean or
you reach **3 rounds**. The tricky case is a **disputed finding** — the implementer
argues a finding is wrong (e.g. *"that path isn't reachable"*) and makes no code change.
Don't re-loop the implementer (you'll get the same dispute or a coerced, pointless edit)
and don't silently drop it. **Adjudicate it once:**

1. Re-check **only that finding** with the reviewer that **owns** it — reachability is
   `security-reviewer`'s lane, a boundary question is `architecture-reviewer`'s. Spawn a
   **fresh, minimal** agent (never *resuming* one — that re-bills its whole transcript,
   see cost discipline) and hand it the implementer's **exact rebuttal as new evidence**.
   Ask it to either **uphold** (refuting the argument point by point) or **drop** the
   finding.
2. **Dropped →** the change is clean; converge to Step 9/10, noting the adjudication.
   **Upheld →** stop and surface it to the user as a decision: the finding (`file:line`,
   severity), the implementer's rebuttal, the reviewer's counter, and your recommendation
   under the threat model.

This single adjudication is a cheap scoped re-check, **not** an implementer round, so it's
worth doing even at the round cap — it can resolve the dispute without bothering the human.
But adjudicate **at most once per finding**, and never open a **fourth** implementer round:
a finding that survives one adjudication — or any finding still open at the **3-round
implementer cap** — is a human call, not another loop.

## Step 9 — doc-writer (optional agent, optional step)

If the change introduces something worth documenting — a new module, a public API, an
architectural decision, or a user-facing flow — spawn `doc-writer` to produce the doc
in the right place (README / ADR / architecture doc), following the repo's own docs
layout from Step 0.5. Skip it for internal-only or trivial changes; when unsure, ask the
user. **If the agent isn't installed**, skip the step and note in the report that the
change may warrant docs nobody wrote.

## Step 10 — final report

Summarise the run so the outcome is reviewable:

- **Spec:** the spec path (one-line scope), or "none — crisp request".
- **Plan:** the plan path (execution mode) + the `spec-conformance` verdict.
- **Implemented:** what landed; typecheck/lint/build status; how many implementers ran.
- **Tests:** what was added + the real pass/fail output — **or, if `test-writer` wasn't
  available, state up front and unmissably that no new tests were written for this change
  and it ships unverified beyond the existing suite.** Never let a skipped test step read
  as a pass.
- **Reviews:** each reviewer's rollup verdict, and how many loop rounds it took. Name any
  reviewer that didn't run and why — *skipped by judgement* and *agent not installed* are
  different facts and the user needs the right one.
- **Docs:** what `doc-writer` wrote, if anything.
- **Skipped steps:** every step that didn't run because its agent is absent, in one place.
- **Verdict:** merge-ready, or the open items the user must decide. A pipeline with
  skipped steps is "merge-ready **with these gaps**", never plain merge-ready.

Afterwards, when the run taught you something non-obvious about this repo, record it with
the `engineering-insights` skill; to review how the run itself went — cost, parallelism,
what to change next time — the user can run `/sdd-engineering:workflow-retro`.

## Orchestration rules (why these matter)

- **Pass context explicitly.** Leaf agents can't see this conversation. Every `Task`
  prompt must carry the project profile, the spec path, the plan path, the diff base, the
  changed-file list, and (on loop-back) the precise findings. Vague delegation produces
  vague work.
- **Discover once, here.** You establish the repo's module map, stack, commands, and
  artifact locations at Step 0.5 and hand them down. A subagent re-reading `CLAUDE.md`
  because your prompt was thin is a cost you pay once per agent, every run.
- **You are the only orchestrator.** No dispatched agent may spawn another; that
  invariant is what bounds this pipeline's cost. If work needs splitting, split it here.
- **Two files are the contracts.** The spec is the WHAT/WHY; the plan is the HOW. Every
  stage from planning onward hangs off one or both — keep stages stateless across that
  boundary.
- **Parallel only where independent.** The code reviewers (Step 7) don't depend on
  each other, so one message with all their `Task` calls is far faster than serial.
  Everything else — including the `spec-conformance` gate — is a dependency chain; keep
  it serial.
- **Respect the approval gates.** Never jump from request to plan to code without the
  user's go at the spec gate (Step 2) and the plan gate (Step 4) — those are the two
  places a wrong direction is cheap to correct.
- **Honour each agent's read-only contract, and keep the two writers in their lanes.**
  The reviewers and both verifiers never edit. Only two agents write, and they don't
  overlap: the **implementer** writes production **source** (and runs existing checks),
  `test-writer` writes **test files**. Never ask the implementer to author tests or the
  test-writer to change source. If a reviewer "suggests a rewrite", that's a direction for
  the implementer, not a patch to apply yourself.
- **Let the technical skills do the domain work.** Don't restate framework guidance in a
  prompt — point the agent at the skill for the stack it's touching (e.g.
  `typescript-expert`, `zod`, `fastify-best-practices`, `drizzle-orm-patterns`,
  `postgresql-table-design`, `react-best-practices`, `next-best-practices`,
  `react-testing-library`, `mermaid-diagram`), where one is installed and relevant.

## Cost & robustness discipline (keep the pipeline cheap)

A real run's telemetry showed **cache-read is ~93% of all tokens** — each agent's context
re-bills on *every* turn — so cost scales with **conversation length × context size**, not
model tier (tiers are already set per agent). Optimise for *fewer, shorter, leaner* agent
turns and *zero wasted runs*. The rules that matter most:

- **Discover the repo once (Step 0.5) and pass the profile down.** Every subagent that
  re-reads `CLAUDE.md` to rebuild the same module map is a full discovery you pay for
  again. This is the cheapest large saving in the pipeline.
- **Split a big implementation by layer** when it spans **>1 module**, **~15+ files**, or
  an expected **~150+ turns** — the file/turn threshold applies *within* a single module
  too (split a big single-module build by sub-layer: foundation → components → wiring). Keep
  a single run below that threshold. In multi-agent mode this is Step 5's fan-out. **Phases
  sharing a wire-contract *file* are not an exception:** thread that hook/route/type
  signature forward and split anyway — a real run kept one 337-turn / ~$54 implementer as a
  single agent *just because* its phases shared one shared module, when threading the
  contract would have been far cheaper.
- **Tier exploration cheaply — never let it inherit your model.** Spawn the tiered
  `researcher` (Sonnet), not a generic built-in subagent, which runs at *your*
  tier: exploring while on Opus makes Opus explorers (a real run paid ~$9 for three broad
  sweeps Sonnet/Haiku would have done for ~$1–2). Pass an explicit `model: haiku` for a
  reasoning-light sweep.
- **Sequence the two clarify gates so the user is never asked the same thing twice** —
  the spec settles WHAT (Step 2), the plan asks only HOW (Step 3). Resolve any
  `implementation-planner` question the spec already answers from the spec, not the user.
- **The `spec-conformance` gate is cheap by design** — two documents on `sonnet`. Use it
  to catch spec-coverage gaps *before* the expensive implementer run, not after.
- **One-retry-then-DIY** on a dropped single-shot agent (esp. `spec-creator` /
  `implementation-planner`) — resume once, then write the artifact yourself rather than
  burning a third resume.
- **Scope every re-verify** to the specific findings/files, with a **fresh, minimal**
  agent — never by *resuming* a reviewer (that re-bills its entire transcript). If you
  already hold the evidence (e.g. pasted green test output), skip the agent entirely.
- **Run verification foreground**; background a sub-agent only when there's parallel work
  to overlap, and never *poll* one — completion notifications fire automatically.

The full rationale plus the rest of the rules (lean per-agent context, exploration,
model escalation, and *why* each holds — with the token figures from the real run) lives
in **[`references/cost-discipline.md`](references/cost-discipline.md)**. Read it before a
large, multi-package, or loop-heavy run.

## What this skill is NOT for

A quick fix, a rename, a one-file tweak, or a docs-only change — those don't need a
spec, a plan, tests, and three reviewers. Use the single relevant agent (or just do it).
This pipeline earns its overhead on multi-step features where a spec, planning, and
independent review actually de-risk the change.
